Technologies

JQuery
Bootstrap
Font awesome

Testing

As far as the testing for a almost static website
I tested the nav button, I tested if all the links work and if it dropped down correctly, the only thing Im not sure how to fix is when the dropdown part of the button hoovers over the photoslide. if you click something from the dropdown while it hovers over the photoslide it will use the photoslide for some reason
I tested the bootstrap photoslide and figured out it didnt work without Jquery
I also had troubles with different sized images but that was fixed when correcting the image sizes,

Deployment

Logged into GitHub

Acknowledgements:
As a 10 year old I composed my own electronic music the love for this type of music has never died. Therefore the choice of making my own DJ homepage is obvious
Some sites I looked at to see how I want to build my site:
https://rudgr.com// (this is my neighbour)
https://www.kygomusic.com/  I really liked the way his site was clean and not busy.
